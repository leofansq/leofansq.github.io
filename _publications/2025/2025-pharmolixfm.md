  Atomic interactions lie at the heart of molecular structures and functions, serving as the foundation for a wide range of molecular interaction tasks. To establish a unified framework for modeling diverse molecular systems, we propose Pharmolix-FM, a generative model that operates at the all-atom level, enabling consistent representation and interaction modeling across different biomolecules. Pharmolix-FM integrates multiple state-of-the-art generative modeling approaches and allows for unified evaluation across multiple tasks without the need for fine-tuning. Through a systematic comparison of different generative algorithms within this framework, we provide a comprehensive analysis of their effectiveness in molecular interaction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Pharmolix-FM achieves superior performance across various tasks, highlighting its potential for advancing molecular interaction modeling.
