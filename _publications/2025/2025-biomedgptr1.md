  Molecule-centric scientific discovery relies on accurate molecular understanding and effective targeted editing. Although recent advances in large reasoning models have demonstrated significant performance advantages in natural language and vision-language tasks, existing approaches have yet to explore biomedical multimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce BioMedGPT-R1, a biomedical multimodal reasoning model, and investigate its capabilities in molecular understanding and editing. The model is trained using a three-stage `see-understand-edit' learning strategy. This approach guides the model to first `see' the molecule, then `understand' it, and finally `edit' it. The strategy comprises three key components: cross-modal alignment, multimodal supervised fine-tuning for efficient molecular understanding, and multimodal reinforcement learning for explainable molecular editing. To facilitate model evolution, we design specific instruction templates, a answer template, and a reward system. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and highlight the power of multimodal reasoning in advancing molecular scientific discovery.
