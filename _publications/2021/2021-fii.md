  We proposed a foreground segmentation approach for anchor-free object detection, which could alleviate the background influences under the complex traffic environment with little extra computation cost. On the basis of that, a novel traffic object detection network with foreground attention, called FII-CenterNet, is developed. It is evaluated on <em>KITTI</em> and <em>PASCAL VOC</em>, and achieves the SOTA performance in both accuracy and efficiency.
