  We proposed a systematic approach for learning the spatial contextual feature, including the local spatial contextual information representation, the local spatial contextual feature learning, and the global spatial contextual feature learning. On the basis of that, a corresponding module for spatial contextual learning is designed. The module could be easily embedded into various network architectures for point cloud segmentation, naturally resulting in a new 3D semantic segmentation network with an encoder-decoder architecture, called SCF-Net. It is evaluated on <em>S3DIS</em> and <em>Semantic3D</em>, and performs better than several SOTA methods in most cases.
