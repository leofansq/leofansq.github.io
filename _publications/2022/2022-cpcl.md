  We proposed a novel semi-supervised learning approach for semantic segmentation, termed Conservative-Progressive Collaborative Learning (CPCL), to not only take the advantage of the high-quality labels but also make the full use of the large quantity of the unlabeled data. CPCL is realized via the intersection and union pseudo supervision, which cooperate with each other and achieve the collaboration of conservative evolution and progressive exploration. In addition, a confidence-based dynamic loss is proposed to reduce the pseudo supervision noise. CPCL is simple, efficient and flexible. It is evaluated on <em>Cityscapes</em> and <em>PASCAL VOC 2012</em>, and achieves SOTA performance for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, especially in low-data regime.
