  Orienting a comprehensive understanding of a traffic area, we need Roadside Cooperative Perception (RCooper) to achieve area-coverage roadside perception. Rcooper has its own domain-specific challenges, but further exploration is hindered due to the lack of datasets. We hence release <em>the first real-world, large-scale RCooper dataset</em> to bloom the research on practical roadside cooperative perception, including detection and tracking. The manually annotated dataset comprises 50k images and 30k point clouds, including two representative traffic scenes (i.e., intersection and corridor). The constructed benchmarks prove the effectiveness of roadside cooperation perception and demonstrate the direction of further research.
