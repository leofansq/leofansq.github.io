  We proposed a road detection network, which integrates the classification results based on different feature combinations by weighted voting. To focus on key samples, a novel loss function is proposed. The loss function can attach importance to hard samples and pay different attention to missed detection and false detection. The method is evaluated on <em>KITTI</em>, and its effectiveness is verified.
