  We proposed a systematic multimodal learning approach for practical RGB-T (thermal) segmentation, termed Spatial-aware Demand-guided Recursive Meshing (SpiderMesh), to leverage the additional thermal signals in a proactive manner. SpiderMesh (1) proactively compensates inadequate contextual semantics in optically-impaired regions via a demand-guided target masking algorithm and (2) refines multimodal semantic features with recursive meshing to improve pixel-level semantic analysis performance. We further introduce an asymmetric data augmentation technique M-CutOut, and enable semi-supervised learning to fully utilize RGB-T labels only sparsely available in practical use. It is evaluated on <em> MFNet</em> and <em> PST900</em> datasets, and achieves SOTA performance on standard RGB-T segmentation benchmarks.
