  Aiming at interpretable and flexible cooperative perception, we propose the concept of query cooperation in this paper, which enables instance-level feature interaction among agents via the query stream. To specifically describe the query cooperation, a representative cooperative perception framework (QUEST) is proposed. It performs cross-agent query interaction by fusion and complementation, which are designed for co-aware objects and unaware objects respectively. Taking camera-based vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception as a typical scenario, we generate the camera-centric cooperation labels of <em>DAIR-V2X-Seq</em> and evaluate the proposed framework on it. The experimental results not only demonstrate the effectiveness but also show the advantages of transmission flexibility and robustness to packet dropout. In addition, we discuss the pros and cons of query cooperation paradigm from the possible extensions and foreseeable limitations.
