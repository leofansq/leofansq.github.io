  Addressing the practical challenges of various installation postures and calibration noises caused by inevitable natural factors (e.g., wind and snow), we point out the significant performance degradation of calibration-based BEV detection approach under calibration noise, and propose the Calibration-free BEV Representation network (CBR) for infrastructure perception. CBR achieves feature view standardization via decoupled feature reconstruction. The perspective view features are decoupled to front view and bird-eye view via MLPs without any calibration parameters, and orthogonal feature fusion is similarity-based without additional depth supervision. It is evaluated on the large-scale real-world dataset <em>DAIR-V2X</em>, and achieves a better accuracy-robustness balance.
